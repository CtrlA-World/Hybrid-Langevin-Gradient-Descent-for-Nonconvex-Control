# Hybrid-Langevin-Gradient-Descent-for-Nonconvex-Control
This repository is in reference to the "Hybrid Langevin-Gradient Descent for Nonconvex Control" paper I wrote as a final project for EE546 course in Spring 2025. You can find all the source codes, codes I wrote, and the benchmark for all the material included in the paper.
